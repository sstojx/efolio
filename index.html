					<h2>Summary</h2>
				</header>
				<p>The following document aims to justify  that I have met the Australian Professional Teaching Standards set by the  Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership through evidences  gathered from my studies at the Christian Heritage College (CHC), the two  practicum placements and my employment at Warrigal Rd State School. I have done this by addressing one sub-descriptor of  one standard at a time providing evidences and giving brief justifications.  Documents  used for multiple descriptors have been colour coded. Many standards  descriptors have been addressed through the units of study I undertook during  my education and training at the CHC.</p>
